For this mini-project, I’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. I won’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when I will submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. For me, this is not the first time I’ve actually tried to “build” something in HTML, but is the second time (very exciting!).

Using the browser’s developer tools will be my best friend. I will build the page in a .html text file and open it in my browser to check it out.
